# LESCO_Billing_System
A desktop application for the LESCO billing system developed in Java, enhanced with a user-friendly GUI built using Java Swing. It supports secure management of employee login 
credentials, customer records, and billing information using file I/O. The system allows employees to manage meter readings, generate monthly bills, apply tariffs and taxes, and
update payment status. A robust search bar enables instant filtering of displayed data. Customers can view their bills, update CNIC expiry dates, and employees can track reports on paid and unpaid bills, as well as CNIC expiries.
